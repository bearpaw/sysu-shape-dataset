# SYSU-Shape Dataset #

## Description ##

SYSU-Shapes dataset is a new shape database including elaborately annotated shape contours. Compared with the existing shape databases, this database includes more realistic challenges in shape detection and localization, e.g., cluttered backgrounds, large intraclass variations, and different poses/views, in which part of the instances were originally used for appearance-based object detection.

There are 5 categories, i.e. airplanes, boats, cars, motorbikes, and
bicycles, and each category contains 200 âˆ¼ 500 images. The shape contours are carefully labeled by a professional team using the LabelMe toolkit. It is worth mentioning that each image has at least but not limit to one object of a given category.
